# The Universal Python Dependency Installer
This quick, simple script can be a little addition to any Python project.  Simply edit into the script the dependencies required to run your project, and boom!  Any machine with Python installed can now run this script, and all of the required dependencies will be installed for you.  Enjoy!

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
